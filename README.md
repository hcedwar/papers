# C++ Standard Committee Papers

Official C++ Standard Committee papers are available from [the C++ mailings][].

More information on the C++ Standard Committee is available on
[the Committee site][].

Papers here use [bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed).

Papers in this repository are final and published when numbered `N` or `P`,
and are drafts when numbered `D`. This is an ISO thing: I can't revise
already-published `N` or `P` papers. The paper revision (the `R` part in `P`
numbered papers) has to be incremented, and a new paper published.

New paper numbers are obtained through the Committee's Vice-Chair. The Committee's
website details [how to submit proposals][].
